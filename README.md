This dataset contains info about 2015 flight delays and cancellations. 


The website will show a heatmap of the world. The brightest parts of the map would be where delays are most frequent. When the user mouses over a specific region on the map, data about the delays (such as average delay time, most frequently delayed airlines, or day of week with most delays) at the airports there would be displayed. The user can see more detailed flight info about specific airports by clicking on the region on the map wher the airport is located.


The project would be similar to a [chloropleth](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606) 
and a [click to zoom map](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/2206590)
