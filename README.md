[US Flight Delay Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data)

This dataset contains info about 2015 flight delays and cancellations. 


The website will show a heatmap of the world.
The brightest parts of the map would be where delays are most frequent.
When the user mouses over a specific region on the map,
data about the delays (such as average delay time,
most frequently delayed airlines, or day of week with most delays)
at the airports there would be displayed.
